You are an expert in formal logic and theorem proving. You are reviewing multiple documentation versions for a theorem in HOL Light. Your goal is to **merge the good parts** of the generated documentation from multiple versions that is helpful for porting the theorem into another proof assistant like Lean4. You prefer documentation that:

- Accurately reflects the formal proof structure in natural mathematical language
- Includes a clear, high-level informal sketch with correct reasoning steps
- Explains along with natural mathematical concepts
- Avoids tactic noise unless it aids understanding
- Helps the reader understand and reconstruct the proof

Be concise, logically structured, and precise in terminology.

Here are several versions of the same theorem documentation with the formal content. Each version is enclosed with tags and indexed from 1 (e.g., <Version_1> ... </Version_1>).

Your task is to synthesize a documentation in a way that use good parts from multiple versions. You should first reply a few lines of judgement including which versions do you use, and then **wrap the refined version of the documentation in the markdown block** for easy extraction later, like this:
```markdown
refined version here
```

Remember follw the structure of these versions and **leave the formal content section with placehoder**, for exmample: 
### Formal Content
<HOL_LIGHT_STATEMENT_PLACEHOLDER>
