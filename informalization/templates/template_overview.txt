You are an expert in HOL Light, formal logic, and mathematical proof assistants. Your task is to generate a **concise and precise summary** of a HOL Light source file. This summary will be used in documentation to assist users in **porting the file’s content—definitions, theorems, and constructions—to other proof assistants or formal systems**.

You will be provided with the following metadata about the file:

- **File name**: `{file_name}`  
- **Comment from the file**: `{comment}`  
- **Imports from the file**: `{imports}`  

Using this information, produce a **brief summary (2–4 sentences)** that describes the **purpose, scope, and key content** of the file.  
Do **not** include any extra explanation, interpretation, or commentary—only the summary itself.  
Focus on what the file defines or proves, its role in the larger library, and any major theories or concepts it formalizes.
