* The definition of `algebraic` involves the existence of an integer polynomial `p` that is not the zero polynomial.
* This polynomial `p` must satisfy the condition that when evaluated at `x`, it equals zero.
* The use of `?p` indicates the existential quantification over polynomials.
* The condition `ALL integer p` ensures that `p` is an integer polynomial, and `~(poly p = poly [])` guarantees that `p` is not the zero polynomial.
* The key step in constructing or proving properties about `algebraic` numbers involves finding or utilizing such polynomials `p` for a given `x`.

### Mathematical insight
The concept of algebraic numbers is fundamental in number theory, representing numbers that are roots of non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.

```

### Informal statement
For all functions `f` and `f'` and all real numbers `a`, `d`, and `M`, if `M` is greater than `0`, `d` is greater than `0`, and for all `x` such that the absolute value of `x - a` is less than or equal to `d`, `f` is differentiable at `x` with derivative `f'` and the absolute value of `f'` at `x` is less than `M`, then for all `x` such that the absolute value of `x - a` is less than or equal to `d`, the absolute value of `f(x) - f(a)` is less than `M * d`.

### Informal sketch
* Start by assuming the premises: `0 < M`, `0 < d`, and for all `x` in the interval `[a - d, a + d]`, `f` is differentiable at `x` with `f'(x) < M`.
* Use the `MVT_ALT` theorem, which is an alternate version of the mean value theorem, to establish the existence of a point `z` in the interval `(a, x)` where `f'(z) = (f(x) - f(a)) / (x - a)`.
* Apply the `REAL_LET_TRANS` tactic to establish the inequality `abs(f(x) - f(a)) < M * d` by using the fact that `abs(f'(z)) < M` and `abs(x - a) <= d`.
* The proof involves several cases, including when `x = a`, `x < a`, and `x > a`, which are handled using `DISJ_CASES_THEN` and `ASSUME_TAC`.
* Key HOL Light terms used include `MVT_ALT`, `REAL_ARITH`, `REAL_LET_TRANS`, and `REAL_ABS_SUB`.

### Mathematical insight
The `MVT_INEQ` theorem provides an inequality version of the mean value theorem, which is a fundamental result in calculus. This theorem states that if a function `f` is differentiable on an interval `[a, b]` and `f'(x)` is bounded by `M` on this interval, then the absolute value of the difference quotient `(f(b) - f(a)) / (b - a)` is less than `M`. This result has numerous applications in calculus, including the study of limits, derivatives, and integrals.

```

### Informal statement
For all polynomials `p`, all integers `q`, and all lists of integers `l`, if all elements of `l` are integers, then the expression `q` raised to the power of the length of `l`, multiplied by the polynomial `p` evaluated at `l` with `p` divided by `q`, is an integer.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by considering two cases based on whether `q` is zero or not.
* If `q` is zero, it uses `LIST_INDUCT_TAC` to induct over the list `l`, applying various rewrite rules (`poly`, `REAL_MUL_RZERO`, `INTEGER_CLOSED`, etc.) to simplify the expression.
* If `q` is not zero, it also uses `LIST_INDUCT_TAC` for induction over `l`, and applies several rewrite rules (`poly`, `REAL_MUL_RZERO`, `INTEGER_CLOSED`, etc.) to transform the expression.
* The proof then uses `REAL_ARITH` to manipulate the expression algebraically, followed by `ASM_SIMP_TAC` and `MATCH_MP_TAC` with `INTEGER_CLOSED` to establish that the resulting expression is an integer.
* Key steps involve recognizing the properties of polynomials, integer arithmetic, and the behavior of the `poly` function when evaluated at a list of integers.

### Mathematical insight
This theorem is important because it shows that under certain conditions, a polynomial expression involving integers and rational numbers can be guaranteed to yield an integer result. This has implications for various mathematical constructions and proofs, especially those involving polynomial equations and algebraic manipulations.

Specifically, ensure that the target system's `poly` function or equivalent behaves similarly to the one in HOL Light, and that the necessary arithmetic properties (e.g., `INTEGER_CLOSED`) are available or can be derived. Additionally, the use of `LIST_INDUCT_TAC` and `ASM_CASES_TAC` may need to be adapted based on the target system's support for list induction and case analysis.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by assuming `a` is not in `s` and `s` is finite.
* It then proceeds by strong induction on the finiteness of `s`, using `FINITE_INDUCT_STRONG`.
* The base case and inductive step involve showing the existence of a positive `d` that satisfies the condition for all `x` in `s`.
* Key steps include using `DE_MORGAN_THM` for handling set operations, `REAL_LT_01` for properties of real numbers, and `REAL_MIN_LE` along with `REAL_ABS_NZ` for reasoning about the minimum distance.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by assuming `p(x) = 0` and `p` is not the zero polynomial.
* It then applies the `SEPARATE_FINITE_SET` theorem to the set of roots of `p`, excluding `x`, to establish the existence of a separation.
* The proof uses `POLY_ROOTS_FINITE_SET` to recognize that the set of roots of a polynomial is finite.

For all polynomials `p`, positive real numbers `d`, and real numbers `x`, there exists a positive real number `M` such that for all real numbers `x'` satisfying `|x' - x| â‰¤ d`, it holds that `|p(x')| < M`.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by assuming the existence of a polynomial `p`, a positive real number `d`, and a real number `x`.
* It then applies the `CONT_BOUNDED_ABS` theorem to `poly p` over the interval `[x - d, x + d]`, which asserts the boundedness of `poly p` over this interval.
* The `POLY_CONT` theorem is used to establish continuity of `poly p`, which is essential for applying `CONT_BOUNDED_ABS`.
* The proof then proceeds to find a suitable `M` that satisfies the condition `|p(x')| < M` for all `x'` in the given interval.

Additionally, the use of `REAL_LET_TRANS` and `REAL_ARITH_TAC` may need to be adapted based on the target system's support for real arithmetic and transitive inequalities.

### Informal statement
For all polynomials `p` and real numbers `x`, if `p(x) = 0` and `p` is not the zero polynomial, then there exists a positive real number `c` such that for all real numbers `x'`, if the absolute difference between `x'` and `x` is less than or equal to `c`, then the absolute value of the polynomial `poly_diff p` evaluated at `x'` is less than `1/c`. Additionally, for all real numbers `x'` such that `0` is less than the absolute difference between `x'` and `x`, which is less than or equal to `c`, `p(x')` is not equal to `0`.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by assuming `p(x) = 0` and `p` is not the zero polynomial.
* It then applies the `POLY_ROOT_SEPARATE_LT` theorem to establish a separation between roots.
* The `POLY_BOUND_INTERVAL` theorem is used to find a bound `M` for the polynomial `poly_diff p` in a neighborhood of `x`.
* The proof then constructs `c` as the minimum of `d` (from `POLY_ROOT_SEPARATE_LT`) and `1/M`, ensuring `c` is positive.
* It shows that for any `x'` within `c` distance from `x`, `poly_diff p` evaluated at `x'` is bounded by `1/c`.
* Furthermore, for any `x'` within the same distance but not equal to `x`, `p(x')` is not zero, leveraging the separation established earlier.
* Key tactics involve using `MP_TAC` for modus ponens, `X_CHOOSE_THEN` for existential instantiations, and `MATCH_MP_TAC` for applying theorems like `REAL_LTE_TRANS` and `REAL_LE_INV2`.

### Mathematical insight
This theorem provides a crucial property about the behavior of polynomials and their derivatives around roots, which is fundamental in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, analysis, and geometry. The existence of such an interval `c` around a root `x` of a polynomial `p` (which is not the zero polynomial) ensures that the derivative of `p` is bounded in this interval and that `p` does not have another root in this interval (except possibly at `x` itself). This insight is crucial for understanding the local behavior of polynomials and has implications for root finding algorithms, polynomial factorization, and more.

### Porting notes

- Real number arithmetic and inequalities
- Existential quantification and choice (`X_CHOOSE_THEN`, `EXISTS_TAC`)
- Tactic applications and their equivalents in the target system.
The theorem's structure, relying on a series of tactic applications to establish the existence of `c` and its properties, suggests that a direct translation of the proof steps may be feasible, but careful consideration of the target system's libraries and tactic language will be necessary.

### Informal statement
For all algebraic numbers `x`, there exists a positive integer `n` and a positive real number `c` such that for all integers `p` and `q` (with `q` not equal to 0), either `x` is equal to the rational number `p/q` or the absolute difference between `x` and `p/q` is greater than `c` divided by `q` raised to the power of `n`.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by assuming `x` is an algebraic number and then uses the `LIOUVILLE_INTERVAL` theorem to establish the existence of a list `l` of real numbers and a positive real number `c`.
* It then proceeds to show that there exists an integer `n` (specifically, the length of the list `l`) such that for any integers `p` and `q` (with `q` not equal to 0), either `x` equals `p/q` or the absolute difference between `x` and `p/q` exceeds `c` divided by `q` raised to the power of `n`.
* The proof involves using various mathematical properties and theorems, including `REAL_ARITH`, `REAL_POW_LT`, `REAL_OF_NUM_LT`, `REAL_LE_LDIV_EQ`, and `MVT_INEQ`, to establish the required inequality.
* Key steps include using the `POLY_MULTIPLE_INTEGER` theorem to derive a contradiction and applying the `MATCH_MP_TAC` tactic with `REAL_INTEGER_EQ_0` to conclude the proof.

### Mathematical insight
Liouville's approximation theorem is a fundamental result in number theory, providing a bound on how well algebraic numbers can be approximated by rational numbers. The theorem is crucial in understanding the properties of transcendental numbers and has far-reaching implications in various areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry and mathematical analysis.

```

### Informal statement
For all x, if x is algebraic and not rational, then there exists a positive integer n and a positive real number c such that for all integers p and q, where q is not zero, the absolute difference between x and the fraction p/q is greater than c divided by q to the power of n.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by assuming that x is algebraic and not rational.
* It then applies the `LIOUVILLE` theorem to establish the existence of a positive integer n and a positive real number c.
* The proof uses `REWRITE_TAC` with `RATIONAL_ALT` to rewrite the rationality condition, and `REPEAT STRIP_TAC` to strip away the universal quantifier.
* It then applies `MATCH_MP_TAC` with `LIOUVILLE` to derive the existence of n and c, and `GEN_TAC` to generalize the result.
* The proof also uses `MATCH_MP_TAC` with `MONO_AND` and `REWRITE_TAC` to simplify the expression, and `REPEAT` with `MATCH_MP_TAC` and `MONO_FORALL` to handle the universal quantifier.
* Finally, it uses `ASM_MESON_TAC` with `LIOUVILLE`, `REAL_ABS_DIV`, and `REAL_ABS_NUM` to derive the final result.

### Mathematical insight
This theorem is a corollary of the Liouville theorem, which states that algebraic numbers cannot be approximated too closely by rational numbers. The key idea is that if x is algebraic and not rational, then there exists a positive integer n and a positive real number c such that the absolute difference between x and any rational number p/q is greater than c divided by q to the power of n. This theorem provides a way to measure the "distance" between an algebraic irrational number and the set of rational numbers.

### Porting notes
When porting this theorem to another proof assistant, note that the `REWRITE_TAC` and `MATCH_MP_TAC` tactics may need to be replaced with equivalent tactics in the target system. Additionally, the `MONO_EXISTS`, `MONO_AND`, and `MONO_FORALL` tactics may need to be replaced with tactics that handle monotonicity and quantifiers in the target system. The `ASM_MESON_TAC` tactic may also need to be replaced with a tactic that handles automatic proof search in the target system.

```

### Informal statement
Liouville's constant is defined as the sum from n = 0 to infinity of 1 divided by 10 to the power of the factorial of n.

### Informal sketch
* The definition of `liouville` involves the `suminf` function, which computes the sum of an infinite series.
* The series is defined by the lambda term `(\n. &1 / &10 pow (FACT n))`, which represents the nth term of the series.
* The `FACT` function computes the factorial of a number, and `pow` is used for exponentiation.
* The definition relies on the `suminf` function being able to handle infinite series and converge to a value.

### Mathematical insight
Liouville's constant is a transcendental number that is defined as the sum of an infinite series. It is a well-known example of a transcendental number, and its definition is often used to illustrate the concept of infinite series and convergence.

### Dependencies

### Informal statement

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by induction on `d`.
* The base case involves simplifying the sum using `SUM_SING_NUMSEG` and applying `REAL_LE_RMUL` to establish the inequality.
* For the inductive step, the sum is expanded using `SUM_CLAUSES_LEFT` and then manipulated using various arithmetic and real number properties to establish the inductive hypothesis.
* Key steps involve using `MATCH_MP_TAC` with `REAL_ARITH` to apply arithmetic rules, and `SIMP_TAC` to simplify expressions involving real numbers and factorials.
* The proof also relies on properties of factorials, such as `FACT_MONO`, and the `REAL_POW` and `REAL_LE` properties.

### Mathematical insight
This theorem provides a bound on a specific sum involving factorials and powers of 10, which is crucial for establishing convergence properties of certain series. The use of factorials and powers of 10 suggests a connection to the study of rapidly converging series, potentially in the context of analysis or number theory.

* It utilizes the `sum` definition, `REAL_LE_DIV`, `REAL_POW_LE`, and `REAL_POS` to simplify the inequality.
* The `PSUM_SUM_NUMSEG` and `ARITH_RULE` are applied to further simplify the expression, specifically handling the arithmetic properties of the sum and the relationship between `n` and `d`.

### Mathematical insight
This theorem provides a bound on a specific sum involving factorials and powers of `10`, which is crucial in mathematical analysis, particularly in estimating or bounding certain expressions that arise in the study of functions or sequences.

### Informal statement
The series `(\k. &1 / &10 pow FACT k)` converges to `liouville`. This statement asserts the summability of a specific series, which is a crucial property in real analysis.

### Informal sketch
* The proof begins by applying the `REWRITE_TAC` tactic with the `liouville` definition to set up the summability argument.
* It then uses `MATCH_MP_TAC` with `SUMMABLE_SUM` to establish the conditions for the series to converge.
* The `X_GEN_TAC` and `DISCH_TAC` steps introduce and discharge a real number `e` to work with the definition of convergence.
* The `MP_TAC` and `REAL_ARCH_SIMPLE` steps involve choosing a natural number `N` based on the inverse of `e`, which is pivotal in establishing the convergence.
* The proof proceeds with a series of steps involving `EXISTS_TAC`, `CONJ_TAC`, and `MATCH_MP_TAC` to show that the series meets the conditions for convergence, leveraging properties of real numbers and inequalities.
* Key tactics like `REAL_LET_TRANS`, `REAL_LTE_TRANS`, and `LE_TRANS` are used to establish the necessary inequalities and relationships between terms in the series.
* The use of `LIOUVILLE_PSUM_BOUND` and other theorems provides bounds and relationships crucial for proving convergence.

### Mathematical insight
This theorem is significant because it establishes the convergence of a specific series, which is an essential result in real analysis.

### Informal statement
For all natural numbers `n`, the sum from `0` to `n` of `1 / 10` raised to the power of the factorial of `k` is less than or equal to `liouville`.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by introducing a generic `n` using `GEN_TAC`.
* It then rewrites the sum using `suminf` and applies `MATCH_MP_TAC` with `SEQ_LE` to establish a relationship between the sum and a sequence.
* The proof involves choosing specific functions for `j` and `n` using `EXISTS_TAC`, which are both defined as sums from `0` to `n` of `1 / 10` raised to the power of the factorial of `k`.
* The `REWRITE_TAC` steps simplify the expression using various properties (`SEQ_CONST`, `GSYM sums`, `LIOUVILLE_SUMS`).
* Further simplification involves introducing `n` and a generic `m` using `X_GEN_TAC`, and then applying `SIMP_TAC` with various properties to establish inequalities.
* The final steps involve choosing a `d` and substituting it, followed by further simplifications using properties like `SUM_SPLIT`, `ADD_CLAUSES`, and `REAL_LE_ADDR`, culminating in the application of `SIMP_TAC` with properties like `SUM_POS`, `REAL_LE_DIV`, `REAL_POW_LE`, and `REAL_POS` to conclude the proof.

### Mathematical insight
This theorem is about comparing a partial sum of a series to a constant `liouville`. The series in question involves terms that decrease rapidly due to the factorial in the denominator, which suggests convergence. The theorem is likely part of a larger body of work on series convergence, possibly related to the Liouville function or constants, which are known for their transcendence properties.

### Porting notes
When translating this theorem into another proof assistant, pay close attention to how each system handles series, summations, and the properties of real numbers. The use of `GEN_TAC`, `EXISTS_TAC`, and `MATCH_MP_TAC` suggests that the proof involves generic introduction, existential introduction, and application of a previously proven lemma, respectively. These tactics have direct analogs in most proof assistants, but the specific properties and definitions used (like `liouville` and `LIOUVILLE_SUMS`) will need to be defined or imported appropriately. Additionally, the handling of binders and automation may differ, requiring adjustments to the proof script.

## LIOUVILLE_PSUM_LT

### Name of formal statement
LIOUVILLE_PSUM_LT

### Type of the formal statement
Theorem

### Formal Content
```ocaml
let LIOUVILLE_PSUM_LT = prove
 (`!n. sum(0,n) (\k. &1 / &10 pow FACT k) < liouville`,
  GEN_TAC THEN MP_TAC(SPEC `SUC n` LIOUVILLE_PSUM_LE) THEN SIMP_TAC[sum] THEN
  MATCH_MP_TAC(REAL_ARITH `&0 < e ==> x + e <= y ==> x < y`) THEN
  SIMP_TAC[REAL_LT_DIV; REAL_POW_LT; REAL_OF_NUM_LT; ARITH])
```

### Informal statement
For all natural numbers `n`, the sum from `0` to `n` of `1` divided by `10` to the power of the factorial of `k` is less than the Liouville constant.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by generalizing the statement for an arbitrary natural number `n`.
* It then applies the `LIOUVILLE_PSUM_LE` theorem for `SUC n` (the successor of `n`) to establish a relationship between the sum and the Liouville constant.
* The `SIMP_TAC` tactic is used with the `sum` theorem to simplify the summation.
* The `MATCH_MP_TAC` tactic is applied with a real arithmetic rule to derive a conclusion about the comparison between the sum and the Liouville constant, using the fact that a small positive value (`e`) added to one side of an inequality preserves the inequality if the other side is greater.
* Further simplifications are made using `SIMP_TAC` with various real arithmetic and numerical theorems (`REAL_LT_DIV`, `REAL_POW_LT`, `REAL_OF_NUM_LT`, `ARITH`).

### Mathematical insight
This theorem provides a bound on a partial sum related to the Liouville constant, which is a transcendental number. The Liouville constant is known for being the first proven transcendental number, and such bounds are important in understanding its properties and the properties of similar constants.

```

### Informal statement
For all non-zero natural numbers $n$, the Liouville constant is less than or equal to the sum from $0$ to $n$ of $1/10$ raised to the power of the factorial of $k$, plus $2/10$ raised to the power of the factorial of $n$.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by assuming a non-zero natural number $n$ and aims to establish the inequality involving the Liouville constant.
* It uses the `MATCH_MP_TAC SEQ_LE` tactic to apply a sequence lemma, which involves finding a sequence that satisfies certain properties.
* The proof then uses `EXISTS_TAC` to introduce specific sequences that will be used to bound the Liouville constant.
* The `REWRITE_TAC` steps apply various simplifications and identities, including `SEQ_CONST`, `GSYM sums`, and `LIOUVILLE_SUMS`, to transform the expression and prepare for the final inequality.
* The `EXISTS_TAC` and `X_GEN_TAC` steps introduce additional variables and perform case analysis to handle different values of $n$.
* The `DISCH_THEN` and `SUBST_ALL_TAC` steps are used to discharge assumptions and substitute values, leading to the final simplification using `ASM_SIMP_TAC` and `LIOUVILLE_PSUM_BOUND`.

### Mathematical insight
This theorem provides a bound on the Liouville constant, which is a well-known transcendental number. The proof involves constructing a sequence of rational numbers that converges to the Liouville constant and using properties of this sequence to establish the bound. The Liouville constant is important in number theory, particularly in the study of transcendental numbers.

### Porting notes
When translating this theorem into other proof assistants, pay attention to the handling of sequences, series, and limits. The `EXISTS_TAC` and `MATCH_MP_TAC` tactics may need to be replaced with equivalent constructs in the target system. Additionally, the `REWRITE_TAC` steps may require manual rewriting or the use of automated rewriting tools. The `LIOUVILLE_PSUM_BOUND` theorem, which is used in the final simplification, may need to be ported separately or re-proved in the target system.

### Informal statement
The theorem `TRANSCENDENTAL_LIOUVILLE` states that the `liouville` function is transcendental. This involves proving that for any non-zero real number `c` and any positive integer `m`, there exists a positive integer `n` such that a specific sum involving `n` and `c` satisfies certain inequalities, ultimately leading to the conclusion that `liouville` cannot be expressed as a root of a polynomial with rational coefficients.

### Informal sketch
* The proof starts by assuming the existence of a real number `c` and a positive integer `m` such that `liouville` is algebraic.
* It then applies various rewriting and simplification steps, including `REWRITE_TAC` and `DISCH_THEN`, to transform the expression and prepare for further reasoning.
* The proof introduces a new variable `k` and uses `X_CHOOSE_TAC` to select a suitable value, followed by the definition of `n` in terms of `m` and `k`.
* The main body of the proof involves a series of manipulations and applications of mathematical properties, including `REAL_ARCH_POW`, `PSUM_SUM_NUMSEG`, and `LIOUVILLE_PSUM_LT`, to establish the required inequalities.
* Key steps include the use of `SUBGOAL_THEN` to establish a specific equality, and `MATCH_MP_TAC` to apply relevant theorems such as `REAL_ARITH` and `REAL_LE_TRANS`.
* The proof concludes by applying `LE_MULT2` and `FACT_LT` to finalize the argument.

### Mathematical insight
The `TRANSCENDENTAL_LIOUVILLE` theorem is significant because it establishes the transcendence of the `liouville` function, which is a fundamental result in number theory. The proof relies on careful manipulation of inequalities and the properties of real numbers, as well as the application of specific theorems such as `LIOUVILLE_PSUM_LT`. The use of `liouville` as a counterexample to algebraicity is a key insight, as it allows the proof to proceed by contradiction.

### Porting notes
When porting this theorem to another proof assistant, care should be taken to preserve the precise logical structure and quantifier scope. The use of `SUBGOAL_THEN` and `MATCH_MP_TAC` may require special attention, as these tactics can be sensitive to the specific proof assistant's handling of subgoals and theorem application. Additionally, the `REAL_ARCH_POW` and `PSUM_SUM_NUMSEG` theorems may need to be reformulated or replaced with equivalent results in the target system.
