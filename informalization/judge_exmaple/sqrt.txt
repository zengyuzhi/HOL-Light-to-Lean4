Judge feedback: 1. Syntax Check  
- All markdown headings are properly opened and closed.  
- Sections such as Name, Type, Formal Content, Informal statement, Informal proof (synonymous with Informal sketch), Mathematical insight, Dependencies, and Porting notes are present and well formatted.  
- No unclosed sections or malformed LaTeX formulas are found.  
- The placeholder <HOL_LIGHT_STATEMENT_PLACEHOLDER> is allowed as per instructions.  
=> Passes Criterion 1.

2. Semantic Faithfulness of Informal Statement  
- The formal statement asserts: For all natural numbers n, if sqrt(n) is rational, then there exists an m with n = m^2.  
- Informal statement says exactly that, and further commentary states that sqrt(n) is rational iff n is a perfect square.  
- The iff is not part of the formal statement here, but the theorem only states the forward direction (rational sqrt implies perfect square). The informal statement says "In other words, the square root of a natural number is rational if and only if that number is a perfect square." That is stronger than the formal content.  
- The formal statement does NOT say "if and only if", only if. So the informal statement is overstating the theorem.  
=> This is a semantic mismatch.

3. Mathematical Validity of Informal Sketch  
- The informal sketch gives the standard approach: assume rational sqrt(n) = p/q with integers p,q, qâ‰ 0, square, get n = (p/q)^2, rearranged as |q|^2 n = |p|^2, then by applying EXP_MULT_EXISTS conclude n = m^2.  
- This is the standard valid proof of the precise claim in the formal statement.  
=> Passes Criterion 3.

Summary:  
The only issue is that the informal statement includes an "if and only if" characterization that is not fully supported by the formal statement, which only states one implication. This overstates the formal theorem.

Final verdict:

\boxed{1}  

Reason: The informal statement claims an "if and only if" characterization that is not established by the formal statement, which only proves the "if sqrt(n) is rational then n is a perfect square" direction. This overstates the theorem, failing criterion 2.
