## Overview

Number of statements: 3

This file formalizes L'Hôpital's rule, a theorem in calculus used to evaluate limits of indeterminate forms. It builds on the analysis library to provide a formal proof of the rule, which states that when two functions approach 0/0 or ∞/∞ at a point, their limit equals the limit of their derivatives under certain conditions. The implementation likely includes the formal statement of the rule, necessary lemmas, and the complete proof structure.

### Informal statement
This theorem states the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem:

For real functions $f$ and $g$, and real numbers $a$ and $b$ with $a < b$, if:
1. $f$ and $g$ are continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$
2. $f$ and $g$ are differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$

Then there exists a point $z \in (a,b)$ and real numbers $f'$ and $g'$ such that:
- $f'$ is the derivative of $f$ at $z$
- $g'$ is the derivative of $g$ at $z$
- $(f(b) - f(a))g' = (g(b) - g(a))f'$

### Informal proof
The proof applies the Mean Value Theorem (MVT) to an auxiliary function constructed specifically to make the Cauchy Mean Value Theorem work.

- We define the auxiliary function $h(x) = f(x)(g(b) - g(a)) - g(x)(f(b) - f(a))$
- Apply the standard Mean Value Theorem to $h$ on the interval $[a,b]$
- For this, we first verify that $h$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ using `CONT_SUB`, `CONT_MUL`, and `CONT_CONST`
- Next, we show that $h$ is differentiable on $(a,b)$, using the facts that $f$ and $g$ are differentiable there
- The derivative of $h$ at any point $x \in (a,b)$ is $f'(x)(g(b) - g(a)) - g'(x)(f(b) - f(a))$, where $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ at $x$
- From the Mean Value Theorem applied to $h$, we get a point $z \in (a,b)$ such that $h(b) - h(a) = h'(z)(b-a)$
- Computing $h(b) - h(a)$ yields $0$, therefore $h'(z) = 0$
- Since $z \in (a,b)$, we know that $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at $z$, giving us derivatives $f'$ and $g'$
- Substituting the expression for $h'(z)$, we get $f'(g(b) - g(a)) - g'(f(b) - f(a)) = 0$
- Rearranging gives us the desired result: $(f(b) - f(a))g' = (g(b) - g(a))f'$

### Mathematical insight
The Cauchy Mean Value Theorem is a generalization of the standard Mean Value Theorem and serves as a key tool in proving L'Hôpital's rule. It relates the ratio of differences in function values to the ratio of their derivatives at some point in the interval.

The theorem essentially states that for two differentiable functions on an interval, there exists a point where the ratio of their derivatives equals the ratio of their differences at the endpoints. This is particularly useful when analyzing limits of quotients of functions.

The proof technique of creating an auxiliary function that combines the original functions in a specific way is a common approach in analysis. This auxiliary function is crafted so that applying the standard Mean Value Theorem to it yields the desired result.

### Informal statement
Let $f, g$ be functions, $f'$ and $g'$ their derivatives, $c, L \in \mathbb{R}$, and $d > 0$. Assume:

1. For all $x$ such that $0 < |x - c| < d$, both $f$ is differentiable at $x$ with derivative $f'(x)$, $g$ is differentiable at $x$ with derivative $g'(x)$, and $g'(x) \neq 0$.
2. $f(c) = 0$ and $g(c) = 0$.
3. $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = 0$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0$.
4. $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L$.

Then $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L$.

### Informal proof
This proof implements a weak form of L'Hôpital's rule for the indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$.

First, we establish an intermediate result: for any $x$ with $0 < |x - c| < d$, there exists a point $z$ between $c$ and $x$ (so $0 < |z - c| < |x - c|$) such that $f(x) \cdot g'(z) = f'(z) \cdot g(x)$.

To prove this intermediate result:
* Consider two cases: either $c < x < c+d$ or $c-d < x < c$
* In the first case ($c < x$), apply the Mean Value Theorem to both $f$ and $g$ on the interval $[c,x]$
* In the second case ($x < c$), apply the Mean Value Theorem to both $f$ and $g$ on the interval $[x,c]$
* In both cases, we get a point $z$ between $c$ and $x$ satisfying the required equation

Now for the main proof:
* Given $\epsilon > 0$, by the assumption that $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L$, there exists $r > 0$ such that if $0 < |x - c| < r$, then $|\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} - L| < \epsilon$
* Take $k = \min(d, r)$ so that both our intermediate result and the limit condition apply
* For any $x$ with $0 < |x - c| < k$, by our intermediate result, there exists a $z$ with $0 < |z - c| < |x - c| < k$ and $f(x) \cdot g'(z) = f'(z) \cdot g(x)$
* Therefore, $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(z)}{g'(z)}$ (since $g'(z) \neq 0$ and $g(x) \neq 0$ by Rolle's theorem)
* Since $|z - c| < r$, we have $|\frac{f'(z)}{g'(z)} - L| < \epsilon$
* Therefore, $|\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} - L| < \epsilon$, which proves that $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L$

The fact that $g(x) \neq 0$ for $x \neq c$ is proved by contradiction using Rolle's theorem: if $g(x) = 0$ for some $x \neq c$, then by Rolle's theorem, there would be a point $w$ between $c$ and $x$ where $g'(w) = 0$, contradicting our assumptions.

### Mathematical insight
This theorem presents a weak form of L'Hôpital's rule, specifically for the indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$ where both functions actually evaluate to zero at the point of interest (not just in the limit).

L'Hôpital's rule is a fundamental result in calculus that provides a method for evaluating limits of quotients when direct substitution leads to an indeterminate form. The standard version applies to limits where both numerator and denominator approach zero or both approach infinity.

The key insight is that when dealing with an indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$, the behavior of the ratio near the critical point is determined by the ratio of the derivatives. This works because the derivatives capture the rate of change of the functions as they approach the critical point.

This specific version has stronger hypotheses than the most general form of L'Hôpital's rule:
- It requires both functions to actually equal zero at the point (not just in the limit)
- It requires the functions to be differentiable in a punctured neighborhood
- It requires $g'(x) \neq 0$ in this neighborhood

### Porting notes
When porting this theorem:
1. The proof relies heavily on the Mean Value Theorem and Rolle's Theorem - ensure these are available in the target system.
2. The proof uses a case analysis based on whether $x > c$ or $x < c$ - this approach should transfer well to other systems.
3. Pay attention to the handling of division by zero - the proof uses Rolle's theorem to establish that $g(x) \neq 0$ for $x \neq c$ in the relevant neighborhood.
4. The `diffl` notation in HOL Light is defined as $(f \text{ diffl } l)(x)$, meaning $f$ is differentiable at $x$ with derivative $l$. Other systems might represent this differently.

### Informal statement
This theorem is a statement of L'Hôpital's rule for the $\frac{0}{0}$ indeterminate form. It states:

For functions $f$, $g$, $f'$, $g'$, and real values $c$, $L$, and $d$:
- If there exists $d > 0$ such that:
  - For all $x$ where $0 < |x - c| < d$:
    - $f$ is differentiable at $x$ with derivative $f'(x)$
    - $g$ is differentiable at $x$ with derivative $g'(x)$
    - $g'(x) \neq 0$
  - $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = 0$
  - $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0$
  - $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L$

Then:
- $\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L$

### Informal proof
The proof of L'Hôpital's rule is based on applying a weaker version (`LHOPITAL_WEAK`) to functions that are redefined to be 0 at the point $c$.

1. We apply `LHOPITAL_WEAK` to the modified functions:
   - $f^*(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } x = c \\ f(x) & \text{if } x \neq c \end{cases}$
   - $g^*(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } x = c \\ g(x) & \text{if } x \neq c \end{cases}$

2. We simplify using the fact that when $0 < |x - c|$, we know $x \neq c$, so the redefined functions behave exactly like the original functions.

3. For points $x$ where $0 < |x - c| < d$, we need to show that the modified functions have the same derivatives as the original functions:
   - For $f^*$, we show that its derivative is equal to $f'(x)$ by showing both expressions calculate the same limit
   - For $g^*$, we similarly show that its derivative is equal to $g'(x)$

4. The key step is using `LIM_TRANSFORM` to establish that the derivatives of the modified functions match the original derivatives at points $x \neq c$.

5. Finally, we leverage the fact that the functions are equal everywhere except at $c$, and the derivatives are equal for all $x$ in the specified neighborhood, so the limit of the ratio $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$ as $x \to c$ equals $L$.

### Mathematical insight
L'Hôpital's rule is a fundamental result in calculus that provides a method for evaluating limits of indeterminate forms. The specific case handled here is the $\frac{0}{0}$ form, where both the numerator and denominator approach zero as the input approaches a certain value.

The key insight is that the ratio of the derivatives often gives the correct limit when the ratio of the original functions leads to an indeterminate form. This makes it an essential tool for evaluating limits in calculus.

The theorem extends the weaker version (`LHOPITAL_WEAK`) by handling the case where the functions are not necessarily zero at the point $c$. It does this by redefining the functions to be zero at $c$ and showing that this does not affect the limit.

2. Pay attention to how differentiability is defined in the target system - HOL Light uses `diffl` which defines differentiability in terms of limits
3. The proof makes clever use of redefining functions at a point - ensure your target system can handle this or find an alternative approach
4. The theorem relies on properties of real numbers and limits, so ensure these basic foundations are established first
