  -- [Informal Proof]
  -- The proof demonstrates that composing two reflection operations with angles $s$ and $t$ is equivalent to a rotation by $2(s-t)$:
  -- 1. We begin by expanding the definition of `reflect2d`, where $\text{reflect2d}(t) = \text{rotate2d}(t) \circ \text{cnj} \circ \text{rotate2d}(-t)$
  -- 2. We rewrite the composition into its complex number representation:
  --    - $\text{rotate2d}(θ)$ corresponds to multiplication by $e^{iθ}$ in the complex plane
  --    - $\text{cnj}$ is the complex conjugate operation
  -- 3. We simplify using properties of complex conjugation:
  --    - $\overline{\overline{z}} = z$
  --    - $\overline{e^{it}} = e^{-it}$
  --    - $\overline{z_1 \cdot z_2} = \overline{z_1} \cdot \overline{z_2}$
  --    - $\overline{i} = -i$
  -- 4. Through algebraic manipulation of exponentials, we arrive at:
  --    $$\text{reflect2d}(s) \circ \text{reflect2d}(t) = \text{multiplication by } e^{i \cdot 2(s-t)}$$
  -- 5. Since multiplication by $e^{i \cdot 2(s-t)}$ is exactly the action of $\text{rotate2d}(2(s-t))$, the theorem is proven.
