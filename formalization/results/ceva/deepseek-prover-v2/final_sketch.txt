-- BETWEEN_THM
theorem between_thm {x a b : α} :
    between x (a, b) ↔ ∃ u, 0 ≤ u ∧ u ≤ 1 ∧ x = u • a + (1 - u) • b := by
  -- Proof outline:
  -- 1. Rewrite using convex hull characterization of betweenness
  -- 2. Apply symmetry of convex hull for {a,b} = {b,a}
  -- 3. Use alternate characterization of 2-point convex hull
  -- 4. Simplify set membership and vector arithmetic
